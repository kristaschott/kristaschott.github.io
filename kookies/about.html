                <h1>How did Krista's Kookies Get Its Start?</h1>
                <p>Krista's Kookies was founded by Krista herself. She started in her tiny apartment kitchen, just baking for friends and family. Everyone always ranted and raved about her cookies, so finally she asked herself, "Why don't I start making money off of these things?"</p>
                <p>Next thing she knew, she was selling cookies for events, but still baking everything in her tiny kitchen.</p>
                <p>Soon what started out as almost a joke, turned into a complete business</p>
                <p>Krista's Kookies originally started in February of 2018, but the store front has been open since October 2019.</p>
                <p>Krista's Kookies loves the support they receive from all of their customers. It is truly what makes the business so fun!</p>

                <h3>The Science Behind It All</h3>

                <p>Ever wonder how cookies get put into the oven as dough and then come out as beautiful, soft rounds? Take a look at this video to learn more about the science behind cookies!</p>
