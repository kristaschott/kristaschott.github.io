                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

                <h4>Can I custom order cookies from Krista's Kookies and how long do I have to order in advance?</h4>
                <p>One of the most unique things about Krista's Kookies is the ability to customize your order. Need gluten free? We can do that. Have some who is allergic to dairy or nuts? Yep, we can do that too. Don't see your favorite cookie on the menu? Let us know and we'll see what we can create. We suggest that if you have a custom order, you order 5-7 days in advance. That gives us enough time to brainstorm if you have some new ideas that we've never tried and get you best possible cookies.</p>
