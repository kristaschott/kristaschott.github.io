    <p>I am a big fan of food, and I am a big fan of eating food at restaurants. When looking for a good place to eat, I always browse the internet and look at restaurant’s websites to see if they have any menus on their website. Being able to see a menu before going to a restaurant is a big plus for me. I recently was looking for somewhere to get lunch and came across a few websites. Each website is unique in its own way, but there are definitely two that are way better and one that is not as nice. </p>
    <p>The first website I came across was the <a href="https://atthebrewhouse.com/">Brewhouse</a>. The Brewhouse is a popular place in Helena, but is the website? The answer for me is, yes! I love the Brewhouse’s website. When you first enter the website, you are greeted with a beautiful background picture of the beers they have on tap. You then have the option to choose the downstairs menu or the upstairs menu. I’m usually an upstairs kind of person, but both are great. Their menu is easy to read and offers a few pictures, but not too many. They offer a simple white background which makes everything easy to read. I also love their website because it works well on my phone screen. Most of the time I’m looking at the menu on my phone, so this is a huge bonus. The font seems perfect for the kind of food they are serving. It’s nothing too fancy or special, but it’s just right. They use HTML5 elements in their code. The code is a little messy, but not impossible to understand. The website is easy to navigate. They don’t have a lot of pages, so it’s easy to find what you are looking for. Like I already said, I really like their choice of text. It seems to be fitting for their business and it is simple and not too flashy. The colors are also simple. The main color used is just the white background. This makes the site easy to navigate and easy to see. They aren’t doing anything too crazy or flashy, but it is just right. Overall, their website is simple, but in the best possible way.</p>
    <p>The next website I took a look at was <a href="https://silverstarsteakco.com/">Silver Star Steak Company</a>. Silver Star is known for their amazing steaks, but they also could be known for their nicely put together website. Their website is beautiful. They go with the white, black, and red color theme, which seems perfect for their business. It gives off an elegant vibe and shows what they are made of. Their website is very easy to navigate and offers so much. You can look at their menu, buy a gift card, make a reservation, and learn more about the restaurant all by just visiting the website. One little thing that really sticks out to me is how at the bottom of the page they have testimonials and credit cards that they accept. They are both very unique things that you do not commonly see on restaurant’s websites. You also have the option to see all their different menus which is helpful because they have so much to offer. Their food meus are downloadable PDF’s which is a nice option. Once you download the PDF it is easy and clear to read and there’s no distracting pictures or other elements. They like to boast wherever they can on their website that they are “Helena’s Best Steakhouse”. I also like that they have their phone number and their location right at the top of their website. They use HTML5 elements, and the code is pretty clean. They have a lot on their website, so the code is pretty long. They use a lot of links and have a CSS style sheet linked. Overall, Silver Star’s website gets five stars from me!</p>
    <p>Last, and also least, is <a href="https://www.noshcafehelena.com/">Nosh Café</a>. I am saddened by how poor their website is. I’ve personally never been to Nosh Café, and if their food is anything like their website, I may never want to go (just kidding I’ve heard very good things about their food and want to try it, but I would appreciate if they updated their website a little bit). First and foremost, they need to replace the title of their main page. When you first click on their website the title on the tab reads, “Your Site Title”. This makes it look like their website is still under construction and looks very unprofessional. Their font is somewhat hard to read, and the font they use for their logo clashes with the font they use on their menu items. They are not similar at all. I like the yellow color that they use for their website. It seems to fit their business, but I don’t like how it’s used on their website. The straight lines and sharp corners make the website too boxy, which does not match the font style. The yellow border all the way around is not my favorite. The website is somewhat easy to navigate. There are a few pages to navigate to and it’s not too difficult. They do use HTML 5 elements in their code, but their code is somewhat messy. It looks like they used Squarespace to create their website. One of the only things I really like about their website is the Gallery option on the menu tab. Their food looks delicious (especially their waffles) and I like that they include pictures of their food. It makes me want to go to their restaurant, even though their website is horrendous. </p>
