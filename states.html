    <h1>A Review of State Websites</h1>

    <h3><a href="https://alaska.gov">Alaska</a></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I like the colors of the website.</li>
        <li>The menu bar can be difficult to navigate because if you don't hover over it just right, the drop down options won't show up.</li>
        <li>The website does not work in multiple screen sizes. </li>
        <li>The website has a pretty basic design. There is nothing too exciting about it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a href="https://www.iowa.gov">Iowa</a></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A fun interactive website. It is very eye-pleasing.</li>
        <li>The menu is pretty easy to navigate. I like how when you click on the menu icons it offers a drop down box with more menu items. </li>
        <li>It is pretty easy to find everything you’re looking for a they have a really interactive search box at the top of the page. </li>

    </ul>

    <h3><a href="https://oklahoma.gov">Oklahoma</a></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The website is somewhat boring looking, but it does have a lot of pictures. </li>
        <li>There is no menu to navigate. I don’t like that. </li>
        <li>Because of the lack of menu, it is hard to find what you’re looking for. </li>
        <li>The website does work well in multiple screen sizes, though. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a href="https://www.tn.gov">Tennessee</a></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Good interactive menu at the top of the page. I also like how they have pictures for each of the menu items lower down on the page. </li>
        <li>The colors are kind of boring. </li>
        <li>The menu is easy to navigate and things load quickly. </li>
        <li>It’s pretty easy to find what you’re looking for on the page. </li>

    </ul>

    <h3><a href="https://www.vermont.gov">Vermont</a></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I love all the pictures they use on their home page. It makes it a very interactive experience.</li>
        <li>The website loads quickly.</li>
        <li>They have a nice menu with explanation for each of the items in the menu which I really like. </li>
        <li>There aren’t a lot of colors, but that’s almost a good thing with all the pictures on the page. </li>
        <li>Information is easy to find through the menu. </li>
        <li>The website works in multiple screen sizes. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ranking of the websites</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Vermont</li>
        <li>Iowa</li>
        <li>Tennesee</li>
        <li>Oklahoma</li>
        <li>Alaska</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Overall, all of these websites loaded quickly for me, so that was not a factor used to rate them. Some websites were a little more exciting than others. Vermont and Iowa were a close first and second. Ultimately, I chose Vermont as #1 because of the pretty pictures used on the home page and their interactive menu. I really liked how they describe each menu item in the drop-down box. It makes it very easy to find where you need to go. Tennessee and Oklahoma have very similar websites. They are cool and have good features to them, but just aren’t quite as pleasing to the eye. Alaska comes in last because of their design and layout of the website. To be honest, it is just pretty boring. There is nothing about it that pops out to me and the website does not work in multiple screen sizes, which is a huge downfall.</p>
